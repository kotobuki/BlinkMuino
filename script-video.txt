BlinkMuino Video Script Notes

- Did you know you can run Arduino sketches on a BlinkM Smart LED?

- Here's an Arduino.  We won't need that.

- A BlinkM is: an RGB LED with a tiny computer on the back.  
It can be any color and can run its own light sequences.

- Here is a BlinkM MinM, works just like a BlinkM but is much smaller.

- With an add-on to the Arduino IDE software, and an AVR programmer,
you can start reprogramming your BlinkMs in no time.  AVR programmers can cost under $10.  This one costs about $30.

- Now the AVR chip in BlinkM doesn't have nearly the I/O of a regular Arduino.  -- You are limited to a total of 5 I/O pins.  
-- Two of those can have hardware PWM output.
-- One can be an analog input.
-- If you modify the BlinkM board and remove the LED, you can get more inputs.

- One of the easiest ways to wire up a BlinkM for reprogramming is with 
an adapter cable like this one already made.  

- [[ show diagram ]] Here is a diagram of how to wire it up. 
A higher-rez version will be posted online.

...

- With the BlinkM plugged in and ready to go, download the Arduino software
add-on available here [...] and install it.

Now load up one of the example sketches, like this one that blinks each of
the BlinkM's LEDs one after the other.  Select the type of BlinkM you have,
in this case, it's an older one with an ATtiny45.  Then press "Upload".

- The blue LED on the BlinkM will flash when it is being programmed.
And when it stopped flashing, your sketch starts running.  

- It runs stand-alone, no computer or Arduino board required, just power.

- A more complex example is this one here.  It's a knob-controlled servo

- Here's the diagram for it. [[ show diagram ]]

- Now if you want to go back to the original BlinkM firmware, you can use the
ReflashBlinkM app to get normal operation of your BlinkM back or update it to 
the latest official firmware.
